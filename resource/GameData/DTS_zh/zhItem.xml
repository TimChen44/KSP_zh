Home to the Kerbals, it has just the right conditions to support a vast, seemingly undepletable population of the eager green creatures.&#x000A;&#x000A;Reaching a stable orbit around Kerbin is one of the first things budding space programs strive for. It is said that he who can get his ship into orbit is halfway to anywhere."><![CDATA[一个独一无二的世界,Kerbin拥有平坦的平原,高耸的山脉,以及宽广蔚蓝的海洋.作为Kerbal人的家园,它正好处在一个极佳的条件之下,能够容纳这些大量的,而且看上去数量还不会减少的积极努力着的绿色生物们.刚刚开始发展的太空计划的奋斗目标之一是要到达一个稳定的绕Kerbin轨道.有人说,如果可以让飞船进入轨道,无论你要去哪,你的梦想就已经成功了一半了.]]></string>

Who are those people?"><![CDATA[Eve无疑是太阳系中颜色最紫的物体.它是其中一颗较大并且最显眼的星球,主要就是因为它那非常非常紫的色调.有些人认为它实际上是一颗Kerbin的姐妹行星.好吧,除了那个紫色,跟有毒的大气层,还有超高的大气压和温度以外...其实一点都不像有木有?是谁在这么说的!]]></string>
    <string name="Gilly is a lumpy rock wandering around the orbit of Eve.

    <string name="Dres is a very small planet. It was the first planet considered to be a dwarf. Its orbit is highly irregular and together with its size it took a long time to discover since half the time it was not where scientists expected to find a planet.&#x000A;&#x000A;Due to its nature of frequenting the bad parts of space. This dwarf planet was officially labeled as Not to be trusted by the scientific community."><![CDATA[Dres是一颗很小的行星.这是第一颗被认为是矮行星的行星.它的轨道非常不规则,连同它的大小都花了很长的时间去探索,有一半的时间它都没有在科学家预计的地方出现.由于它在太空里老是跟天文学家玩捉迷藏,这颗矮行星被科学界官方标记为"不被信任的".]]></string>
    <string name="Jool is particularly known for being a rather large, predominantly green planet. Kerbalkind has longed to visit it since it was first spotted in the sky. Philosophers reason that the swirling green planet must be a really nice place to visit, on account of its wholesome coloration.&#x000A;&#x000A;If you look at Jool through a telescope, it is fuzzy."><![CDATA[Jool非常的知名,因为它非常巨大而且主要都是绿色色调.Kerbal人自从在天空中发现它的那一刻起,就一直都渴望能够去到那里.而哲学上的原因是,一想到它健康的颜色,这颗旋转着的绿色星球就一定是一个非常值得一游的地方.如果你在望远镜里观察Jool,它是模模糊糊的.]]></string>

    <string name="Tylo was the first moon of Jool to be discovered by the Kerbal Astronomical Society. After many failed attempts to take a flawless picture of Jool to hang on the office walls, it was finally discovered that the wandering white smear was indeed a moon.&#x000A;&#x000A;Scientists speculate that the view from the surface with Laythe, Vall and Jool overhead must be quite something."><![CDATA[Tylo是第一个由Kerbal天文学会发现的Jool的卫星.在多次尝试想要拍摄一张完美无瑕的Jool的照片挂在办公室的墙上,但是都失败之后,终于发现那个阴魂不散的白色污点竟然是一颗确确实实的卫星.科学家觉得,如果到Laythe表面去看,头顶的Vall和Jool一定"相当壮观".]]></string>
    <string name="Bop is a small moon in the vicinity of Jool. In Kerbal mythology, Bop is believed to be the home of the Kraken, a mischievous creature said to play with the ships of hapless explorers, by spinning them out of control until torn asunder, then casting them into oblivion."><![CDATA[Bop是Jool的一颗卫星.在Kerbal神话中,Bop是认为是海怪的家园,据说那是一个玩弄倒霉探险者的飞船,旋转它们让它们失控直到撕得粉碎,然后把它们变成历史的淘气生物.]]></string>
    <string name="This moon was especially hard to spot, as it looks just like a pollen grain, particularly when observed through telescopes based near dusty fields.&#x000A;&#x000A;Pol was finally discovered when someone decided to write down the location of the pollen, after having given up on yet another failed attempt to be rid of the smudge."><![CDATA[这颗卫星特别的难以被发现,因为它看起来就像一颗花粉粒,特别是在有灰尘的地方附近用望远镜去观测.Pol最后还是被发现了,当时有一个人在试图擦拭污点失败之后,决定放弃,然后记录下了这颗花粉的位置.]]></string>
    <string name="Theres been a considerable amount of controversy around the status of Eeloo as being a proper planet or a just lump of ice going around the Sun. The debate is still ongoing, since most academic summits held to address the issue have devolved into, on good days, petty name calling, and on worse ones, all-out brawls."><![CDATA[对于Eeloo到底是名副其实的行星,还是只是一颗"围绕着太阳的冰疙瘩",目前存在着相当多的争论.这场辩论还将继续,因为大部分的学术峰会都加入进来阐述他们的论点,从友好的问候,到指名骂姓,再到更加糟糕的全面论战.]]></string>
